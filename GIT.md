**Ques: _How do you pass "msg" when you commit your git code?_**
The answer is the "-m" argument when passing commit.

**Ques: _If you were to make a change for a commit done 30 days ago with respect to a machine type used? How would you go about doing this change? Would you directly change it?_**
- git clone -> create new branch -> Then goto githubUI -> git blame (history) -> apply your changes

- Start by cloning the repository and creating a new branch. Then, goto the GitHub UI and utilize the "Blame" feature, which displays the detailed history of changes made to a specific file.

- You can find out when a change was made, what the commit message was, and  what is the motivation for using this particular machine type. All of this information is conveniently presented there.

- By using this data, I initially gain insight into the existing commits and attempt to understand the reasons behind previous changes. With this understanding, I proceed to make my own commit, fully conscious of both my own contribution and the context provided by the previous commits.

**Ques: _What is branch protection in GitHub?_**
- Branch protection in GitHub is a set of security and workflow controls that you can apply to specific branches within a GitHub repository.
- It's designed to help maintain code quality, ensure that certain processes are followed, and protect important branches from accidental or unauthorized changes.
